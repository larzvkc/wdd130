        <p>Grappling in North America has evolved tremendously in the last 10 years with the usage of leglocks. In
            addition, European wrestling techniques have forced many Jiu-jitsu practioners to include other forms of
            grappling in their arsenal of attacks. Because of the MMA style of grappling as a whole, the United States
            of America has become a major hub for practitioners around the world to test their mettle.</p>
