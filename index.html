        <p>I love programming and training Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. I am married and love to spend time with my wife. Life
            is a blessing! My programming experience includes native and framework-free PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, SQL and a
            smidgen of Kotlin. I enjoy building my own solutions and toolsets for the many problems that software
            solves. From the API that emails and texts users generated codes for verification, to full-scale webapp
            generation from form submissions, to an in house CMS, I love embarking upon new challenges.</p>

        <p>Grappling in North America has evolved tremendously in the last 10 years with the usage of leglocks. In
            addition, European wrestling techniques have forced many Jiu-jitsu practioners to include other forms of
            grappling in their arsenal of attacks. Because of the MMA style of grappling as a whole, the United States
            of America has become a major hub for practitioners around the world to test their mettle.</p>
